The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players 
take turns placing their marks on a grid of four-by-four cells. If a given player gets four marks
in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will
be tied if no one gets four in a row by the time all the cells are marked.
